# How to Excel with Integrity in CSE 1411 

At UCSD, academic integrity[1] means that you have the courage, even when
it is difficult, to only submit academic work that is honest,
responsible, respectful, fair, and trustworthy. When you excel with
integrity in computer science, it means that you:


**Honest** submit work that is a truthful demonstration of your
            knowledge and abilities (rather than the knowledge and
            abilities of another)

**Responsible** manage your time so that you are not pressured to
            complete an assignment at the last minute

**Respectful** acknowledge the contributions of others to your work by
            citing them when ve used their words or ideas (e.g., after
            I've spoken to classmates or after I've used portions of
            a code written by another if permitted)

**Fair** complete your academic work according to stated standards and
            expectations even when it takes longer or re struggling

**Trustworthy** can be trusted to be honest, responsible, respectful,
            and fair even when no one is watching you.


When you act contrary to these values, you are cheating. Cheating
undermines trust between students and professors, the value of the
UCSD degree, and your learning/development of skills.

While we can't list every behavior that would be cheating, we can give
you some illustrative examples like the following:

* Submitting any source code written by another person or copied from
  another person, submitting homework answers which were produced by
  another student.

* Submitting code/homework you have previously submitted to another
  course for credit without first obtaining permission from the
  instructor. The same restriction holds for publicly available
  code/homework solutions that you haven't written.  Taking notes
  taken during any discussions with classmates about an assignment is
  prohibited.

* Using words or text written by someone else without citing text
  appropriately. Every figure or sentence fragment must be
  appropriately decorated with quotation marks or indention to
  indicate very clearly that someone else wrote the text. In addition,
  the passage must be labeled with a citation or citation number which
  refers to a footnote or bibliographic entry. Citing a paper once is
  not enough. Remember: citations should be used to illuminate a
  viewpoint which you hold. They are not a substitute for expressing
  your own ideas in your own words.

* Submitting any portion(s) of an assignment you have previously
  submitted for credit in another course.

* Copying from a neighbor during an exam or using an unauthorized aid
  to help you on your exam.

* Altering a graded exam or assignment and resubmitting it for regrade

* Allowing someone else to complete an assignment or exam for you, or
  allowing them to pretend to be you in class (e.g., by signing an
  attendance form or clicking for you).

* Making available to others source code, documentation, or notes
  useful for completing an assignment. You should neither produce,
  procure, nor accept such material. This includes students in
  current, past, and future offerings of the course, and applies to
  electronic transmissions including email, web pages, ftp, and so on,
  as well as hard copy such as source code listings.

If the behavior you are considering isn't listed here, don't assume that it is
allowed.  Rather, you should always do independent work unless told otherwise. And
before completing your academic work in a certain way, you should ask
is it honest, respectful, responsible, fair, and trustworthy.  You can also ask yourself "Would
I be okay if my methods were exposed to the TA, professors, and fellow students?" If the
answer is no, you shouldn't do it.

**If you have any questions about what is and isn't cheating, be sure
  to discuss them with the instructor.**

Any student who cheats, thereby undermining integrity, will be
reported to the Academic Integrity Office. Students who cheat face
various disciplinary sanctions as well as academic penalty imposed by
the instructor in the course.  _Academic penalties include, but are
not limited to, receiving a grade of 0 for the assignment or test in
question, and receiving an 'F' for the course._
